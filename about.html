					Fragrance of nature was founded in 2017 by Andile Sasanti. The business was originally called Fragrance
					of nature and managed by Andile. As a new company, we are creating a modern 100% all natural
					cleaning industry with environmentally friendly products. Service excellence is a key to our success and
					we continue to expand our service nationwide. After noticing a gap in the South African market for a
					reliable and efficient cleaning service, Fragrance of nature was formed. We are a proud supplier of
					Floorwiz assuring innovation in cleaning equipment and eco-green products to create a safer and clean
					environment. Our cleaning solution is not only uncompromisingly dependable and safe, but also a
					formula that delivers the best hygiene results.
